## Development Setup

Managair is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web application atop a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) DBMS. It is meant to be run as part of the Clair backend stack. To start up your development environment, consult the stack's Readme-file.

## Debugging

When run in DEBUG mode, the `managair_server` has the [Python Tools for Visual Studio Debug Server](https://github.com/microsoft/ptvsd) (PTVSD) included. It allows to attach a Python debugger from within Visual Studio Code to the application running inside to container. To get started, copy `dev_utils/launch.json` into your project-local `.vscode` folder. Details on setup and usage can be found in this [blog post](https://testdriven.io/blog/django-debugging-vs-code/).

## Data fixtures

To start development work right away, it would be convenient if important data was preloaded into the DB already. This is what [Django fixtures](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/initial-data/) are for. Fixture files are JSON files that contain data in a format that can be directly importet into the DB. They are available for the individual applications in their `fixture` folders. To set up the the application for development, load the fixtures as follows:

- `docker exec -it managair_server python3 manage.py loaddata device_manager/fixtures/device-fixtures.json`
- `docker exec -it managair_server python3 manage.py loaddata ts_manager/fixtures/sample-fixtures.json`

Make sure to respect the order because of foreign-key constraints.
